3. For my project, which consists of implementing wc.py, gron.py, and ungron.py, I employed a combination of manual testing and automated testing using a custom test harness (test.py).

4. Errors that occur when the program runs differently than expected due to incorrect logic or algorithms. 

While working on wc.py, a script designed to mimic the Unix wc command by counting lines, words, and characters in a file, I encountered a significant issue. After implementing exception handling, I discovered the script was running out of memory. This led me to believe the issue was related to how the file content was being read and processed. I conducted research on memory-efficient file reading in Python and learned that reading large files line-by-line, instead of reading the whole file into memory at once, is more memory-efficient.

5. List of Implemented Extensions

Extension: More Advanced wc - Flags to Control Output
Enhanced the wc.py program to support flags (-l, -w, -c) that control the output to show only lines, words, or characters, respectively.

Added argument parsing using Pythonâ€™s argparse module.
Based on the flags provided by the user, the program selectively counts and displays lines, words, or characters.
Testing:

Test without flags to ensure default behavior (counting lines, words, and characters).
Test with each flag individually and in combination (-lw, -lc, -wc, -lwc) to ensure correct output.
Include test cases for empty input and large files.


Extension: More Advanced gron - Control the Base-Object Name
Modified gron.py to allow a user-defined base object name in the flattened JSON output, using the --obj flag.

Implemented additional command-line argument --obj to specify the base object name.
The JSON flattening function was adjusted to use this user-provided base object name instead of the default json.

Test with the --obj flag to ensure the custom object name is used in the output.
Compare against expected output where the base name is replaced with the specified name.
Test without the --obj flag to ensure default behavior remains unchanged.
